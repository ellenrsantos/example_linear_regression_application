# ðŸ“œ Context:

In this work I explored differents types of Python Libraries for Linear Regression (Scikit Learn).

# ðŸ“– Description:

For this analysis, I chose a open acess dataset available in Kaggle (link below) about various cars from Car Dekho.

Acess link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance/code?datasetId=13720&sortBy=voteCount](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/car-details-dataset/data)

ðŸ““ If you want to see more graphics and the exploratory analysis, jupyter notebook is available. 

# ðŸ’¡ Insights:

1 - LGBMRegressor is the best model with the highest RÂ² score (75.68%) and solid generalization ability.

2 - Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are close competitors but still slightly underperform LGBM.

3 - XGBoost shows strong performance but overfits more, achieving a lower RÂ² (73.0%).

4 - Bagging and Decision Tree models also overfit and have lower test scores.

5 - Linear Regression is the weakest performer, with an RÂ² of 47.24%, indicating it struggles with the dataset's complexity.
